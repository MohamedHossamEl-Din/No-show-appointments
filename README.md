# Project: Investigate a Dataset (No-show appointments)
## by (Mohamed Hossam El_Din)

A project from **Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree**.


## About the data

I'll be analyzing the (noshowappointments-kagglev2-may-2016.csv) dataset, which gives information about more than 100 thousand patients who made medical appointments in Brazil. The data is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.

## project specifications

>The project is well organized through a **jupyter notebook**.

>All code cells can run without errors

>There is a satisfying answer or explanation after each question or result.


### The full process outline:

>1- Taking a quick veiw over the data to know its characteristics and problems.

>2- Cleaning the data: determining the unwanted data, fix inconsistent values.

>3- exploring the data to trace the correlations between its variables.

>4- posing and addressing questions.

>5- conclosion.


### The question I'll be answering:
>Q1: Does Age affect the percentage of patients who show for their appointment?

>Q2: Does Gender affect the percentage of patients who show for their appointment?

>Q3: Does Poverty affect the percentage of patients who show for their appointment?

>Q4: Do handicaps and other health problems affect the percentage of patients who show for their appointment?

>Q5: Does the period between scheduling and attending to the appointment matters?
